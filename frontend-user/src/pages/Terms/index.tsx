          <h2>5. Know your Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Red Kite is a permissionless, fully decentralized platform for token sales, swaps, and decentralized exchange. As a software development company, Red Kite has no role in enforcing KYC by default, however, we do provide such tools for fundraising entities using Red Kite to enforce on their users, if the entities choose to do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on Red Kite by fundraising entities using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Red Kite makes no warranty as to the merit, legality, or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of Red Kite, we nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require KYC/AML on their token sale participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities and/or competent regulatory authorities, Red Kite reserves the right at any time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User.
            </li>
            <li>
              To restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently determined.
            </li>
            <li>
              To share submitted KYC information and documentation to 3rd parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and the end-user (you) agrees to this by using the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              To confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
